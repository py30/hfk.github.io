00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
There are at least as many ways to set up

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.075
a programming environment as there are programmers,

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.740
and there's no right or wrong way to go about it.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.599
However, if you're just starting out in writing

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.035
Python you might like to see my screen to get some ideas.

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.114
Time for a tour of my screen.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.219
Over here, I have my text editor.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.035
I'm using sublime text which is great for getting started,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.428
but my fellow Udacians recommended a notepad++,

00:00:22.428 --> 00:00:25.464
atom, vim and many others.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:29.740
A text editor is really different from a word processor, so don't mix them up.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.834
Code needs to be written line by line,

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.625
with line breaks and indentations included on purpose

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:38.179
and ways that fundamentally change how the code is read and run.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.409
Good text editors have

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.579
simple but vital features such as syntax highlighting and line numbers.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.945
Editors are highly customizable to suit your style.

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.070
One setting that I use on coding in Python

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.740
is the setting that converts tabs into four spaces.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.800
Indentation levels in Python are always multiples of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.608
four spaces and I don't want to be making mistakes as I hit the spacebar.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.024
The tabs shortcut really helps.

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:04.224
The text editor isn't the only thing on my screen right now.

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:09.609
The terminal window is here so that I can run my script.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.504
Generally, I can't write a whole lot of code in one go

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:16.224
because something will go wrong and I'll need to find the issue and debug it.

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:18.564
When there is an error it will show up here,

00:01:18.564 --> 00:01:20.560
in the terminal for me to read.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.975
I make small changes to the code in the text editor,

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:25.359
then run the script to see the output.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.230
If I see a problem I'll try to fix it or if things seem to be working, I'll move on.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.340
I've also got the Udacity classroom and some documentation open in my browser.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.570
Normally, I'll need a browser open to look up

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.419
documentation or to search for the solution to a bug I encounter along the way.
