00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.724
When you're coding, it's tempting to try writing a program that does everything.

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:07.964
Typically, you'll be coding something that you thought was simple,

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:10.150
and then a new idea arises.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.259
You slide it right in,

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.657
because it makes sense to you here and now.

00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:16.364
Before you know it, your code ends up very long,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.209
quite complicated, and basically impossible to debug.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.339
You really don't want such a big code block.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.894
Your program might be full of clever ideas and slick implementation,

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.189
but it's impossible to read and you simply can't

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.859
reuse all that great code somewhere else.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.859
This is why it's important to plan your ideas before you start coding.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.707
That one great idea you're trying to implement,

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:42.339
it's almost certainly got several parts, multiple steps,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.922
or different cases that can be split apart,

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.064
worked on, and put back together again.

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:50.189
Thinking about the pieces of the problem you're solving before

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.849
your fingers even touch the keyboard means you can lay plans,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.240
split up the work, and plan how to test your code early on.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.660
Let's try an example.
