Hey, well done on your work.

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.459
Yeah, you've done a great job.

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:08.445
You have used tuples and practiced using default arguments in your functions.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.550
You also learned to read data from a file and how to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.080
import modules from the standard library and third-party libraries.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.405
You practiced using the Internet to figure out programming questions and problems.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:22.315
This sounds simple but this is a really important skill.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.540
I never program without using the Internet.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.000
In the next section,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.039
we'll be working through a case study together.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.000
We'll be practicing a lot of the skills we've

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.450
discussed so far. It should be a lot of fun.
