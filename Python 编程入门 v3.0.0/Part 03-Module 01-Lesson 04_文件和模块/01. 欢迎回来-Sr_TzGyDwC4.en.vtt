Welcome back. Well done on your work on the lab.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.580
I hope you found out some interesting things about

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.175
the calling and texting habits of the users in that data set.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.500
The lab should have tested a lot of what you've already learned about Python.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.820
Next, we're going to build upon that knowledge.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.344
You will get acquainted with tuples and learn more about writing functions.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:21.839
We'll also show you how to read from files and how to leverage the power of

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.679
the community by importing and using Python modules and libraries.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.429
I see, we should get going.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.000
Yes. Enjoy.
