Hello and welcome. I'm Charlie.

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.984
You're going to learn to write Python programs to solve practical problems.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.065
And I'm Phillip. As Charlie said,

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:10.140
you'll be learning about Python but we'll also be

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.225
demonstrating the skills you need to be an effective programmer.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.359
That's right. There's more to programming than just syntax.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.980
For example, programmers need to be able to take an idea and turn it into

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.120
code and you'll need to be able to research solutions to novel problems.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.810
First though, we should introduce ourselves better.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.544
I've been using Python for seven years.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.155
Mostly as a web developer.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.460
I've worked on payment portals,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.310
internationalizations, web scrapers and general back end work.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.388
Python is also my go to language for solving random problems.

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.248
Even ones that aren't related to web development.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.395
Yeah. Python is good for all sorts of things.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:45.855
In my previous life, I was a mathematician.

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:49.140
My first big Python project was working on Sage which

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920
is open source mathematical software that I was using for my research.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.350
It was surprisingly easy to get started on contributing

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
to Sage and the community taught me a lot.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.640
It sounds like we've had pretty different experiences.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.070
Here's hoping that this is the start of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.310
an exciting Python programming career for you. Let's get to it.
