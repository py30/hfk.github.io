00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.865
I'll calculate the average of these numbers by adding them up and dividing by three.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:07.589
I'll use the print function to see the result.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.809
Hmm.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.419
This is not what I expected. It's an error message.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.614
It's a bit disappointing,

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:20.134
but hopefully the error message will explain the issue.

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:22.480
The bottom line says that I made

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.554
a syntax error and the caret points to the relevant line of the code.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:34.000
So, it looks like I made a typo and left out the first parenthesis in the call to print.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.829
I'll fix it and try again.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.484
OK, good. It worked this time.

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:45.659
Great. Fortunately, this error message was pretty straightforward.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.529
This won't always be the case though.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.185
Sometimes you'll get errors that are more difficult to read.

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:51.795
They can still be helpful though.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:53.984
If you get an error that you don't understand,

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:58.000
copy it into a search engine to get more information about what has happened.
