00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
Nice work so far. You're starting to get to know

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:06.333
Python syntax and use data types including integers,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.322
booleans, floats, and strings.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.574
You've called some of Python's built-in functions,

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.574
compared values, and assigned values to variables.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:17.214
All of these goals will be useful as you continue to learn and program in Python.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.905
Next, you'll start to write your own programs,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:22.920
complete with functions and conditional statements.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.330
We'll see you in the next section.
