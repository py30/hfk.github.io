00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
While you and Charlie have been working on the main loop,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.575
I've been working on the find_first_link function.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:07.710
This collaboration wouldn't be possible if we hadn't planned things out ahead

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.105
of time and broken the crawler down into smaller parts.

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:13.230
Beyond that though, Charlie had to specify

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.054
how her code would use the find_first_link function.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.625
Charlie will call the function by passing in a string.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.420
I don't know what variable names Charlie defined in her part of the program,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.630
so I'll just refer to this function's input as url.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.778
The function does its work and returns another string.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:32.019
The return value is the first link from the article that was passed into the function.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.990
This specification is like a contract between Charlie and me.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.775
If her code provides the correct argument and my code returns the correct result,

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:44.195
then our program will work correctly.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:48.439
Likewise, I can implement the function however I like and Charlie doesn't have to

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.449
worry about how it'll fit into her code because we've

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.000
already agreed on how her code will call the function.
