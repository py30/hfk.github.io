00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
So far, we've been working on figuring out the steps that should be included in

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.035
our code and coded up the continue_crawl

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:09.439
function to control when the while loop should end.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.349
My next job is to work on the contents of that while loop.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
I'll transcribe the full steps we ordered earlier into

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.000
comments in the body of the loop, then add the actual code.
