I tried the new and improved link extraction code,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.490
on this article about Yoshiharu Yamaguchi.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.650
I expected the extraction code to find this link to Osaka, but instead,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.576
it found this little question mark which is actually a link

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.649
to the Wikipedia page about Japanese character sets.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.854
Technically, BeautifulSoup found the right link.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:22.859
But once again, this is not what I really want.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.294
The same behavior can lead to other bugs too.

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:29.545
If the first link in the article is a link to a footnote or a citation for example,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.925
that's what the link extractor will find.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.465
What we really want to do though,

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:36.400
is to find what first link that's to an ordinary Wikipedia article,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.000
not to a help page. How can we do that?
