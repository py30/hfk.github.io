00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
When I'm working with a new library,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.294
I like to try it out in the interactive shell.

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:07.529
This is the fastest way to try out its methods in syntax.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.539
I have opened the Beautiful Soup Documentation besides

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.660
my terminal so I can reference it as I try it out.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.289
The documentation has its convenient quick start guide that we can follow along with.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
Let's start at the Python interpreter and import Beautiful Soup.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.850
The documentation suggests we import the library with this line

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.385
here from bs4 import BeautifulSoup.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:30.670
Next, the documentation shows how to create a soup object from a string.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.515
The quick start guide uses a small html sample that's in a string.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.250
I've always thought though that I learn best when I don't follow some instructions

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.969
exactly so I think I'll make a soup object out of a Wikipedia's html source instead.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.289
Charlie showed us how to get an html string with requests so we'll do that here.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.509
I'll get Wikipedia's main page and store it source in a variable called html.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.504
Let's verify that we got the html.

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:56.265
Whoa, that's a lot of html.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.099
Now, let's make it into a soup object using these instructions from the documentation.

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:08.750
The quick start guide suggests that we get the title tag like this.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.094
Okay, that works.

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:14.929
Good. Let's try getting a paragraph tag.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.498
The documentation says we can do that with soup.p.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.484
OK. This is a lot of html again,

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:24.554
but at least it's just one paragraph.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:29.030
I'll open Wikipedia in my browser to compare this to what the browser displays.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.670
It looks like today's featured articles about Frost's bolete,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200
a type of fungus, and that's the same paragraph we got from Beautiful Soup. Great.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.999
If you want the first instance of a paragraph tag on a page, we use soup.p.

00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:45.622
We can get nested tags like this, soup.p.a.

00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:50.469
This selects the first anchor tag inside of the first paragraph tag.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.420
In this case, it's a link to the featured article.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.519
The rest of this quick start guide shows how to get

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:58.189
lists of anchor tags instead of just one tag.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.459
Install Beautiful Soup, open up the documentation in the terminal,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.140
and try this out for yourself.
