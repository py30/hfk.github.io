00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's apply our knowledge of HTML to a real page.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.924
Here's a Wikipedia article.

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:07.349
I'll use my browser to see its source.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.814
I'm using Google Chrome but every browser has a view source button.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.504
It just might not be in the same place as it is in Chrome.

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:17.085
This HTML isn't as tidy as the example we looked at before.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.685
Unlike Python, HTML doesn't require indentation or organization.

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.714
If you scroll through it though we can see some familiar tags.

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:28.664
Here's a paragraph, some divs and some a herf tags.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:31.394
Let's switch back to the rendered version of the page.

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:35.515
Okay, the first link in the page is this link to the Monty Python article.

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:37.649
Let's try to find that in the source code.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.219
Here it is. It looks like the article's text begins right here.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.199
This link is inside a paragraph tag,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.005
but I can't really tell if the paragraph tag is inside of any other tags.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.920
There's just too much unformatted HTML for me to read.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.230
Fortunately, browsers have tools to make this manageable.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.384
I want to close this source code tab and open the developer tools.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:00.134
These developer tools aren't unique to Chrome.

00:01:00.134 --> 00:01:02.424
Every browser has something similar.

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:05.808
Okay, now we have an organized view of the HTML.

00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.524
I can right click the first link and choose Inspect.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.535
Then the tree of elements in the Tools panel

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.744
expands to show the hierarchy of tags that lead to the link.

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:17.945
It looks like the first link is this a herf tag which is inside of this paragraph tag,

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.634
which is inside of this div.

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:23.420
The div's ID is mw-content-text.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.655
It looks like that div is inside of a chain of a few more divs.

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.555
Excellent, if every article is structured like this one,

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.250
then we should be able to use this information to do our web crawler.
