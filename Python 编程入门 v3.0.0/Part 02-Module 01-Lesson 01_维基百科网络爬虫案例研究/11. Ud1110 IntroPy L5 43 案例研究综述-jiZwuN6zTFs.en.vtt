00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.105
We did it. Putting the work between us and that includes you,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.799
we managed to get our Wikipedia crawler up and running.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.414
Let's review how we did it.

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:14.254
The very first thing we did was to try out clicking the wikipedia links by hand.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:17.940
We came to understand what we were trying to achieve with our program.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.620
Next, we did some learning.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.600
We found out about the structure of the input data HTML,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.005
and we researched useful Python packages that would help us process it.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.894
Next, we designed a program,

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.864
but without coding it up yet.

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:32.564
We made decisions about the kind of loop to use,

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.304
the data structures that we would need,

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:37.619
and decided the steps we would perform and their order.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:41.709
There was also a specific extra item that's important if you're interacting with the Web.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.969
We slowed the program down to avoid it being a nuisance.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.589
Only after all that work did we start writing code.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.420
Charlie wrote the continue_crawl function that controls the while loop,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020
and laid out the main steps inside of that while loop.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.145
In the process, she actually ended up planning a separate function, find_first_link.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.125
She worked out what it would need to do,

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.179
but not actually how to do it.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.670
I was the one who wrote the find_first_link function following Charlie's specification.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.489
I also tested everything to make sure that code

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:12.140
worked on a variety of Wikipedia pages.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.459
I iterated on the code that I had written

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.890
in order to make it work on every Wikipedia page that I found.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.560
You can use these bullet points and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.784
this example to help next time you're writing a program.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:24.554
Depending on the work you're doing,

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:26.130
you might need to change the order,

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.469
or repeat the step more than once.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.000
These are basic steps that you'll come back to again and again when you're programming.
