00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.589
Now that we have defined the problem we're trying to solve,

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.269
gotten familiar with the libraries you want to use and I've broken

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.769
the problem down into smaller pieces, we can begin coding.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.769
There's another benefit to all this planning,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.612
because we have defined the different pieces of our program,

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.809
we can split up the work between us.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.495
Since there's two of us, I think it makes sense to split the work into two major pieces.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:22.260
Yeah. I'll work on writing the main loop.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.005
This part of the code will manage the article_chain,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.044
limits how quickly we make requests,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:28.620
and print the output of the crawl.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.039
And I'll write the code that actually makes the requests and finds the links.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.339
Defining each piece will help us to collaborate,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.220
but we might need to be flexible if things happen that we weren't expecting.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll get started with the continue_crawl function.
