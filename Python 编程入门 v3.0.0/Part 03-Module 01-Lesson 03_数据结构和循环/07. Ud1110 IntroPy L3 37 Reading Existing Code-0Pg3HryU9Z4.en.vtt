00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Next, you'll practice reading and trying to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.919
understand Python code that's already been written.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.019
Whenever you're programming, you need to think about

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.719
the future readers and maintainers of the code you're writing.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.870
In this section, you won't change what the code does,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.914
but you'll first try to understand it in its current state,

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.484
then you'll make it easier to use, read and maintain.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:23.725
Reading and refactoring code are important skills for Python programmer.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:25.836
What do you mean by refactoring, Charlie?

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:31.195
Factoring is another word for decomposing a complex problem into simpler parts.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.855
You practiced that earlier on the Scores To Rating problem.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:39.529
Refactoring just means doing this decomposition process on code that already exists.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.384
It's like reorganizing the workshop.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:46.240
To work efficiently, you need to tidy up so you can find each tool as you need it.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.030
In general, keeping you on top of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.620
the organization of your code will make it easier to maintain.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.000
You'll thank yourself later.
