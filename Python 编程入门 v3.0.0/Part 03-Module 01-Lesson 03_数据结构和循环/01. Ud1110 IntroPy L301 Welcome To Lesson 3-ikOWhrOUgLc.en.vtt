00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome back. The next topic we'll explore is data structures.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.849
So far, our programs have dealt with individual integers, floats and strings.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.490
Now, we'll see how we can store collections of data.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
We'll also learn how to iterate through collections of data with loops.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.060
Along the way, we'll learn about refactoring,

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.979
another software engineering skill.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.219
Enjoy and happy Python programming.
