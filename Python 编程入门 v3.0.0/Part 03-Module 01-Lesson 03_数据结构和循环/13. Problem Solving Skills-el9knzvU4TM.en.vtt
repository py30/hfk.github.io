00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
You've learned a lot of Python so far.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.679
You know how to represent numerical and text data and you know

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.529
how to store collections of data in lists, sets and dictionaries.

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:13.059
Yes, you've collected a set of tools for working with data.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.160
You can use Python's built-in methods and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
functions and you can write functions of your own.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.780
You can iterate with loops and make conditional decisions with if and else.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.476
With these tools, you can solve most programming problems.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.599
Sure, there's more to Python than all we've covered

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.355
so far and we'll get two more topics later on.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.158
But now, it's time to apply the skills you've

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.850
learned so you can practice the craft of programming.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.145
That's right. Programming is more than just syntax.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.095
To solve a problem you need to define it first.

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:44.320
For example, you'll need to think about inputs to

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.560
the program and the results that you should give as output.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.570
Once you thought through the goals of your program,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.679
you need to think about how to break the program down into smaller pieces.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.744
Then, you need to evaluate your plan to make sure it solves the original problem.

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:00.039
I often find that when I plan a new program,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.875
I realize that the problem is more complicated than I had assumed.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:06.689
Planning before coding, helps me understand the problem better.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.870
There are other things to keep in mind when you do begin coding.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.189
You want to write some test cases so that you

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.034
can check that your code does what it's supposed to do.

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.468
You also need to make your code readable.

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:21.089
If your code is so complicated that you could only just understand it,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.460
as you write it, you have no hope of understanding it later on.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.954
Before we move on to the next topics,

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.920
there will be a lab that let's you practice these skills.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.587
Good luck. As you work,

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:33.895
remember to break problems into smaller pieces,

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:38.000
to plan, and to focus on readability. We'll see you soon.
